# Cheaha

Cheaha is a campus HPC resource dedicated to enhancing research
computing productivity at UAB. Cheaha is managed by UAB Information
Technology's Research Computing group (RC) and is available to members
of the UAB community in need of increased computational capacity. Cheaha
supports high performance computing (HPC) and high throughput computing
(HTC) paradigms. Cheaha is composed of resources that span data centers
located in the new UAB Technology Innovation Center and a commercial
data center at DC BLOX in Birmingham. Research Computing, in open
collaboration with the campus research community, is leading the design
and development of these resources.

Cheaha provides users with both a web based interface, via open
OnDemand, and a traditional command-line interactive environment, via
SSH. These interfaces provide access to many scientific tools that can
leverage a dedicated pool of local compute resources via the SLURM batch
scheduler. Cheaha and associated storage has been assessed by external
auditors, and passed a security assessment for HIPAA alignment.

In addition UAB researchers also have access to regional and national
HPC resources such as Alabama Supercomputer Authority (ASA), XSEDE and
Open Science Grid (OSG).
