title: Creating a UAB XIAS Project/Site
---

XIAS Project/Sites, or simply sites, tie external users to specific
resources at UAB. By connecting people to the resource they use, UAB can
maintain security and accountability. Creating a site is the first step
to giving access to external collaborators, and the process can be
thought of as "create once, use many times". All sites must have an
expiration date for security reasons. To create a site you'll need at
least one Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) relating to resources used
by the site. If you aren't sure what URI(s) to list for your site,
please contact <UserServices@uab.edu>.

1.  To start go to the [UAB XIAS Project/Site Management
    Webpage](https://idm.uab.edu/cgi-cas/xrmi/sites).
