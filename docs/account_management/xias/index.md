# External Collaborator (XIAS) Accounts

This segment of the docs has instructions for managing and creating XIAS accounts for external collaborators.

External collaborators require XIAS accounts to access Cheaha. Obtaining an account requires a UAB-employed sponsor, typically a research PI, who will claim responsibility for the external collaborator. The XIAS account creation process is initiated by the sponsor, not by the external collaborator.

An overview of creating an external collaborator account:

1. The sponsor must first:
    1. [Create and manage XIAS Sites](pi_site_management.md)
    2. [Create and manage XIAS Guests](pi_guest_management.md)
2. The guest must then [Create a XIAS Guest Account](guest_instructions.md)

## What is next and how to login to services?

To login to the Cheaha and gitlab services, you need to use your XIAS email address and a password  used to create the XIAS account as credentials. For accessing the cloud service, your username is your XIAS email address, while the password can be any current password you have, not necessarily the same as the one used to create your XIAS email address. For further guidance on how to proceed and what steps to take next, please refer to the following documentation pages.

We recommend the sponsor and guest stay in close contact during the process in case anything unexpected occurs. If you encounter difficulties with any part of the XIAS website process, please contact [AskIT](mailto:askit@uab.edu).
